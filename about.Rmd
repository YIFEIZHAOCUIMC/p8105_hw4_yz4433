## Yifei's website intro

This website is for HW4_p8105 data science course at Columbia University. It shows gif images, navigation of personal links, the resume, and a flexdashboard for rest_inspec dataset. 

All the source code can be found in the github repository.

For the dashboard based on NYC Restaurant Inspections data, we sampled a dataset with the size of 1000.
